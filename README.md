| Opening        | Points  | Cards |
|----------------|:-------:|-------|
| 1♣             | 12 - 14 | Without 5 cards of the same suit. Next bid will show the strongest (longest) suit. |

| 1♦, 1♥, 1♠     | 12 - 14 | 5+ of the bided suit. |
| 1**NT**        | 15 - 19 | Next bid will show the strongest (longest) suit. |
| 2♣             | 20+     | Next bid will show the strongest (longest) suit. |
| 2♦, 2♥, 2♠, 3♣ |  7 - 11 | 7+ cards of the bided suit. |

## Answers
Responding to an opening that shows a suit requires at least 7 points
and should indicate the longest suit.

A response to 1♣, 1**NT**, and 2♣ is mandatory if the opponents have not bid.

With 0-3 points, a negative response should be given, using the lowest possible bid.

With 4 or more points, the response should indicate the strongest suit.

## Asking partner about the number of aces

After deciding the trump suit (or NT) one can ask partner about the number of aces he holds
by saying lowest possible number of clubs.

Responses are:
- ♦ = 0 or 4 aces,
- ♥ = 1 ace,
- ♠ = 2 aces,
- **NT** = 3 aces.

After determining the number of aces, one can ask partner about the number of kings he holds
using the same approach.
